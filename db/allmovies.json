Her dramatic career-from teenage sensation in The Wizard of Oz to epochal Hollywood star-made her a legend, while her troubled private life and charismatic pathos made her a quintessential gay icon. But it turns out there is a Judy we didn't know: in this revelatory new biography, we are treated not only to spectacular film clips and rare concert footage, but to the memories of the one man who was her confidant, producer, manager, and, not incidentally, third husband: Sid Luft. What emerges through Luft's observations, only recently made public, and through Judy's own words is a poignant portrait of a woman whose vulnerabilities were exploited by an industry she helped build, but whose resilience, entrepreneurship, and unfailing commitment to her creative gifts seem particularly modern. Sid & Judy reminds us why generations of LGBTQ+ folks have found in Judy Garland their lodestar of perseverance and joy.","release_date":"2019-06-26T00:00:00.000Z","videoExists":false,"__v":0},{"genre_ids":[35,10749],"genres":["5d13c5a8f376db0004d81a25","5d13c5a8f376db0004d81a2e"],"_id":"5d13c4d49c43030004910cad","id":271718,"vote_average":5.8,"title":"Trainwreck","popularity":19.341,"posterImage":"/2USk7mhiCXRkU9NzttXCzOjg2iV.jpg","original_language":"en","backdropImage":"/aeUT193K0ZxrVwK3zfL2EjoyQWG.jpg","adult":false,"overview":"Having thought that monogamy was never possible, a commitment-phobic career woman may have to face her fears when she meets a good guy.","release_date":"2015-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","videoExists":true,"__v":1,"videoKey":"y_KP9x80Z9Q"},{"genre_ids":[28,53],"genres":["5d13c5a8f376db0004d81a24","5d13c5a8f376db0004d81a28"],"_id":"5d13c4d49c43030004910c9f","id":1571,"vote_average":6.5,"title":"Live Free or Die Hard","popularity":19.519,"posterImage":"/pHWgbaXiQD2nmex7u8Xv6XmhaZS.jpg","original_language":"en","backdropImage":"/yo3LesueMprtgjRiIRmjiIrFIKj.jpg","adult":false,"overview":"John McClane is back and badder than ever, and this time he's working for Homeland Security.

But when the procedure goes horribly wrong, Quaid becomes a hunted man. Finding himself on the run from the police - controlled by Chancellor Cohaagen, the leader of the free world - Quaid teams up with a rebel fighter to find the head of the underground resistance and stop Cohaagen. The line between fantasy and reality gets blurred and the fate of his world hangs in the balance as Quaid discovers his true identity, his true love, and his true fate.","release_date":"2012-08-02T00:00:00.000Z","videoExists":true,"__v":1,"videoKey":"4SerZm7DheA"},{"genre_ids":[35,18],"genres":["5d13c5a8f376db0004d81a25","5d13c5a8f376db0004d81a22"],"_id":"5d13c4df9c43030004910de2","id":37165,"vote_average":8,"title":"The Truman Show","popularity":16.756,"posterImage":"/EelZzudHRvJmjWccWscN1S5vmI.jpg","original_language":"en","backdropImage":"/yw93TFk5L6jZ43yMGitll8CHa6m.jpg","adult":false,"overview":"Truman Burbank is the star of \"The Truman Show\", a 24-hour-a-day \"reality\" TV show that broadcasts every aspect of his life -- live and in color -- without his knowledge.
